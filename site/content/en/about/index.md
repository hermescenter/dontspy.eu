# Don't Spy EU - About the campaign 

Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights, along with fellow nonprofits The Good Lobby Italy and info.nodes (“we”), first launched a campaign called Don’t Spy EU in March 2023.

The campaign’s early phase was about encouraging the general public to challenge MEPs involved in the EU Artificial Intelligence Act negotiations who supported biometric surveillance.

On the [previous version of the campaign’s website, users could scan politicians’ faces with a facial recognition algorithm](https://dontspyonus.eu/).

Our main goal was to show how, by using technology already available on the market, public institutions and private companies could potentially access sensitive information about citizens (age, gender, even emotional state!) and use it as they please – should Remote Biometric Identification (RBI) ever become legal in the EU.

### But, wait, isn’t a ban on RBI already in place? And didn’t the AI Act’s draft include a total ban, initially?

Well, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does include a ban on biometric identification.

However, when the AI Act will become effective, RBI systems will be subject to that law only – given that their software employs Artificial Intelligence.

Like many other nonprofit organizations all around the continent, we are deeply concerned about the trajectory the AI Act is taking.

We’re talking about a major body of legislation, a heavy bulk of norms regulating AI (or attempting to do so) that’s set to be enacted in 2025, eventually becoming the first of its kind at the global level – and, let’s not forget, an important precedent for non-EU countries.

As we write (Autumn 2023), dozens of fellow digital & human rights organizations have already flagged one too many loopholes in the Act, beginning with the very definition of RBI technology.

This [meticulously-written joint statement by EDRi](https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Prohibit-RBI-in-publicly-accessible-spaces-Civil-Society-Amendments-AI-Act-FINAL.pdf) (European Digital Rights coalition) details the threats posed by the current versions of Article 3(36) and Article 5(1)(d), along with recommendations by civil society on how to make sure people’s fundamental rights are protected.

### Yes, RBI might be officially banned… but with some exceptions.

Predictive policing tools and real-time remote facial recognition and biometric identification in public spaces are forbidden, as of now, and the AI Act’s current version maintains this ban as well.

However, exceptions will be granted for ex-post technologies employed in the prosecution of serious crimes and under judicial authorization; law enforcement will also be able to use predictive policing algorithms that analyse personal data in order to identify potential future offenders.

### And who gets to determine who could potentially turn into an “offender”? 

Great question that currently remains unanswered. Just like all the questions/doubts surrounding predictive AI tools employed at the EU border – tools whose rollout phase is currently underway in some cases (see [EU MigraTool](https://www.itflows.eu/eumigratool/)).

# Draw limits on harmful and discriminatory surveillance by national security, law enforcement and migration authorities

Increasingly AI systems are developed and deployed for harmful and discriminatory forms of state surveillance. Such systems disproportionately target already marginalised communities, undermine legal and procedural rights, as well as contributing to mass surveillance. When AI systems are deployed in the context of law enforcement, security and migration control, there is an even greater risk of harm, and violations of fundamental rights and the rule of law. To maintain public oversight and prevent harm, the EU AI Act must include:

##

* A full ban on [real-time and post remote biometric identification](//edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Prohibit-RBI-in-publicly-accessible-spaces-Civil-Society-Amendments-AI-Act-FINAL.pdf) in publicly accessible spaces, by all actors, without exception;
* A prohibition of all forms of [predictive and profiling systems](//www.fairtrials.org/articles/news/ai-act-eu-must-ban-predictive-ai-systems-in-policing-and-criminal-justice/) in law enforcement and criminal justice (including systems which focus on and target individuals, groups and locations or areas);
* Prohibitions on [AI in migration contexts](//edri.org/our-work/civil-society-calls-for-the-eu-ai-act-to-better-protect-people-on-the-move/) to make individual risk assessments and profiles based on personal and sensitive data, and predictive analytics systems when used to interdict, curtail and prevent migration;
* A prohibition on [biometric categorisation systems](//www.accessnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Amendments-to-the-AI-Acts-treatment-of-biometric-categorisation.pdf) that categorise natural persons according to sensitive or protected attributes as well as the use of any biometric categorisation and automated behavioural detection systems in publicly accessible spaces;
* A ban on the use of emotion recognition systems to infer people’s emotions and mental states;
* Reject the Council’s addition of a blanket exemption from the AI Act of AI systems developed or used for national security purposes;
* Remove exceptions and loopholes for law enforcement and migration control introduced by the Council;
* Ensuring public transparency as to what, when and how public actors deploy high-risk AI in areas of law enforcement and migration control, avoiding any exemption to the obligation to register high-risk uses into the EU AI database.
