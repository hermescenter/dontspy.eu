# Don't Spy EU - About the campaign 

**Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights**, along with fellow nonprofits **The Good Lobby Italy** and info.nodes (_we_), first launched a campaign called _Don’t Spy On Us EU_ in March 2023.

The campaign’s early phase was about encouraging the general public to challenge European Parliamentarians who were involved in the EU **Artificial Intelligence Act** negotiations and supported biometric surveillance. On the [old version](//dontspyonus.eu/) of our website, users could scan politicians’ faces with a **facial recognition algorithm**.

Now we are proud to announce the launch of **Don't Spy EU**, our new campaign, on a brand new website. The goal remains the same, that is, to show how, by using publicly-available technology, governments and private companies could potentially access sensitive information about citizens (age, gender, even emotional state) and use it as they please – should Remote Biometric Identification (RBI) ever become legal in the EU.

<br>

# But wait, isn’t a ban on RBI already in place? 

And didn’t the AI Act’s draft include a **total ban**, initially?  Well, the **General Data Protection Regulation** (GDPR) does include a ban on biometric identification. However, when the AI Act becomes effective, RBI systems will be subject to that law only since their software employs Artificial Intelligence.

Like many other nonprofit organizations all over the continent, we are **deeply concerned** about the trajectory the AI Act is taking.

> We’re talking about a major body of legislation, a heavy bulk of norms regulating AI (or attempting to do so) that’s set to be enacted in 2025, eventually becoming the first of its kind at the global level – and, let’s not forget, an **important precedent** for non-EU countries.

As we write (October 2023), dozens of fellow digital rights organizations have already flagged several loopholes in the AI Act, beginning with the very **definition** of RBI technology. This meticulously-written [joint statement](//edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Prohibit-RBI-in-publicly-accessible-spaces-Civil-Society-Amendments-AI-Act-FINAL.pdf) by **EDRi (European Digital Rights initiative)** details the threats posed by the current versions of Article 3(36) and Article 5(1)(d), along with recommendations by civil society on how to make sure people’s fundamental rights are protected.

<br>

# Yes, RBI might be banned… but with some exceptions

As of now, **predictive policing** tools, **real-time remote** facial recognition and biometric identification in public spaces are forbidden, and the AI Act’s current version maintains this ban as well.

However, exceptions will be granted for **ex-post technologies** employed in the prosecution of serious crimes and under judicial authorization; law enforcement will also be able to use predictive policing algorithms that analyse personal data in order to identify potential **future offenders**. And who gets to determine who could turn into an “offender”?

Great question that remains unanswered, just like questions/doubts regarding predictive AI tools employed at the EU border – tools whose rollout phase is currently underway in some cases (see [EU MigraTool](//www.itflows.eu/eumigratool/)).
