# Scanning politicians' faces ‚Äì EU interactive map

European politicians' faces, along with their personal information and **_AI-determined_ age/gender/emotional state**, will be displayed after you **browse** our interactive map, **select** a country and **click** on it. To upload new faces, follow the **instructions [at the bottom of this page](/faces#upload-new-faces)**.

# Why simulating RBI?

Ready to see what **RBI (Remote Biometric Identification)** would do, if ever applied to your country‚Äôs politicians‚Äô faces?

We picked some of the **most prominent political figures** in all EU Member States (up to 5 ministers/national representatives), and ran an open-source **RBI face recognition algorithm** on them.

Why? Because many of them are currently involved in the EU **Artificial Intelligence Act‚Äôs** negotiations (_trialogues_) and their vote could drastically alter the course of how AI is regulated and used.

Now more than ever, it's crucial that they understand the **harms and implications** of RBI technology.

<br>

# What's wrong with RBI?

An RBI-free Europe is still a mirage, since the proposed version of the AI Act **fails to call** for a **comprehensive ban** on biometry. Indeed, invasive **AI policing** is admitted, which undermines the citizens‚Äô right to **privacy** and could lead to **discrimination** and abuse of power.

**Migrants** at the EU border also run the risk of being discriminated against/wrongfully detained by **border agencies** and authorities, since the AI Act does not explicitly prohibit biometric surveillance in those instances.

Let‚Äôs make legislators **change their mind** on AI surveillance.

Before proceeding, please **make sure you read our ‚Äú[About](/about)‚Äù section** detailing Don‚Äôt Spy EU‚Äôs main scope and motives.

<br>

# ‚ö† Keep in mind that...

* Biometric identification is currently banned as per the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**;

* Wait, so‚Ä¶ Are we some sort of _criminals_? Well, technically speaking, ours is an act of **civil disobedience**. We want to make sure our voice is heard ‚Äì loud and clear, as all citizens are facing an imminent threat and Europeans‚Äô **digital future** looks scary.

* **We do not encourage anyone** to repeat this action outside of this campaign. Please keep in mind that if you decide to submit any data or images **we‚Äôll protect your anonymity**. Always.

# _Don't Spy EU_ ‚Äì Database

Below are all the European politicians' faces & info we've managed to collect and insert in our database. Each country can feature a maximum of **five politicians**, but you'll notice some countries only have 1 or 2 politicians.

You can help us build a more complete database, if you want. We are looking for the following roles: **Prime Minister, AI Act Gov. Representative, Justice Minister, Interior Minister and Defense Minister**. To add new politicians, keep scrolling.

# Upload new Faces

We can only accept pictures with faces that belong to politicians already registered in our database.

* Here's the [open source face recognition library](//github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) we use. If the face in the picture you upload doesn't match the expected politician, it will be automatically deleted.

* **Pictures with more than one face** will also be automatically deleted.

* If you want to upload the face of a politician who happens to be **missing** from our index, check out our [criteria](/blog/five-meaningful-figures/).

* Only trusted individuals with a private link can insert a politician in our index. **üôè [Reach out to us](/about#contacts) üôè if you think you can be that person**.
