* **Deepfake is possible** because from the victim **is extracted a facial fingerprint**, which is then pasted over a new _host_. The problem lies when the victim is non consenting and not aware.
* The **face fingerprinting should be forbidden** because beside the targeted surveillance abuse, **it enables the production of deepfakes**, or more in abstract the production of other quasi-realistic human features[*](/deepfake#not-just-faces)
* **If RBI is allowed to exist, the only solution would be to pollute the Internet with fake faces**, as explained in the infographic below. **We hope society will never reach that point!**
* Deepfakes are often associated with unfair practices. They also represent a serious problem in the information ecosystem, because fact-checking is an ex-post action and falsehood sill is spread. **We condamn such abuses**.
