* **Deepfake is possible because a facial fingerprint is extracted from the victim** and then pasted onto a new host. The problem is when the victim does not consent and is unaware.
* **Facial fingerprinting should be banned** because, besides the abuse of targeted surveillance, it enables the production of deepfakes, or more abstractly, the production of other quasi-realistic human features[*](/deepfake#not-just-faces).
* **If RBI is allowed to exist, the only solution would be to pollute the Internet with fake faces**, as explained in the infographic below. We hope society never gets to that point!
* Deepfakes are often associated with unfair practices. They also pose a serious problem in the information ecosystem, as fact-checking is an after-the-fact action, and falsehoods are easily spread. **We firmly condemn such abuses**.

`*` In this regard, we can assume that any human characteristic that can be used to identify a person by digital or natural means should be equally protected. Tools that produce a subject's voice are used to defraud their families and colleagues. A comprehensive AIAct should see these highly personal and persistent characteristics as those that can only be used strictly under the consent and control of the data subject.
