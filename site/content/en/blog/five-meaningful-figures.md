At this stage of the trilogue, **not all political figures are equal**.

# In the DONTSPY.EU campaign, we have chosen to look for these five figures in each member state:

* The **Prime Minister**, as the main reference point of any national council of ministers.
* The **Ministries of the Interior**, because it is under them that the lobbies for surveillance exert their forces.
* The **Ministries of Defence**, because the AIAct's exclusion of AI used for military purposes is a dangerous weakness in our society.
* **Ministries of Justice**, because video surveillance is not a silver bullet, it is known how many pitfalls happen when we rely too much on technology.
* And the **representative for innovation** (this is a figure that could change in each Member State) and is the one who follows the AIAct trilogue negotiations as the link between the national council of ministers and the European trilogue.
