At this stage of the trilogue, **not all political figures are equal**.

# In the DONTSPY.EU campaign, we have chosen to look for these five figures in each member state:

* The **Prime Minister**, as the main reference point of any national Council of Ministers.
* The **Minister of the Interior**, because that’s the target of the surveillance lobby.
* The **Minister of Defence**, because the AI Act’s exclusion of AI used for military purposes is a dangerous weakness in our society.
* The **Minister of Justice**, because video surveillance is not a silver bullet - it is well known how dangerous it can be to rely too much on technology when it comes to people’s personal freedom.
* Finally, **the representative for Innovation** (this is a figure that could change in each Member State) as they’re the ones following the AIAct trilogue negotiations as the link between the national council of ministers and the European trilogue.

# Who do we have so far?

We can only accept pictures with faces that belong to the political figure. There is a process of "initial setup" where trusted individual with a non public link can register a political person. **🙏 [Reach out to us](/about#contacts) 🙏 if you think you can be that person**. Currently we have available these politician registered:
