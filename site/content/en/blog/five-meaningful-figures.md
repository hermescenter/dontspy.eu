At this stage of the trilogue, **not all political figures are equal**.

# DONTSPY.EU, why we chose to look for these five figures in each EU Member State

* **Prime Minister**. In every EU Member State, it's the main reference point of any national Council of Ministers.

* **Minister of the Interior**. It’s the target of surveillance lobbies.

* **Minister of Defense**. The AI Act’s exemption of AI-use for military purposes is a danger to our democratic society.

* **Minister of Justice**. Video surveillance is not a silver bullet. It's become pretty evident how dangerous it can be to rely too much on technology when it comes to people’s personal freedom.

* **Representative for Innovation** (this political figure may vary in each Member State). They’re the ones following the AI Act trilogue negotiations and function as the link between the National Council of Ministers and the European trilogue.

# _Don't Spy EU_ – Database

Below are all the European politicians' faces & info we've managed to collect and insert in our database so far. Each country can feature a maximum of **five politicians**, but you'll notice some countries only have 1 or 2 politicians.

You can **help us build a more complete database**, if you want. To add new politicians, make sure you check out our website's [dedicated section](//dontspy.eu/rbi/#nocoform).
