# This piece summarizes the difficulties in EU policy lobbying is this from Joe McNamee: [How the European Parliament will vote for and against biometric mass surveillance](//www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-european-parliament-vote-against-biometric-mass-joe-mcnamee).

What we know so far is that remote biometric identification is seen as a "bargaining chip" between the Parliament and the Council of Europe - with one exception, of course: If there is no strong demonstration of outrage by civil society.

# This is what we're doing, and the pillars of the campaign are:

* **RBI over the faces of the top ministries** of all EU member states.
* **DeepFake collection** as explained in the page, if RBI become legitimized, then profiles of people based on what is in their picture would become part of everyday profiling, and data pollution would become the only strategy to lower the accuracy of such services.
* **whistleblowing**. We're ready to safely handle leaks about how RBI and political lobbying.
