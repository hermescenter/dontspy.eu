# The first campaign was completed in June '23!


The website of this past campaign [DontSPYonusEU](https://dontspyonus.eu) is now archived. Its objective was to target the Members of the EU Parliament. The campaign is closed.

# The challenge isn't over yet

* We are now entering the final phase of the trilogue, in which remote biometric identification is more often lobbied for as a consolidated necessity for security purposes. Which is not, but that is how it is sold.
* This piece by Joe McNamee summarizes the challenges in EU policy lobbying: [How the European Parliament will vote for and against biometric mass surveillance](//www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-european-parliament-vote-against-biometric-mass-joe-mcnamee).

What we know so far is that remote biometric identification is seen as a "bargaining chip" between the Parliament and the Council of Europe - with one exception, of course: If there is no strong demonstration of outrage by civil society.
