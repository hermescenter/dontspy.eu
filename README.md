### How to run this spaghetti combo?

1. `npm install; npm run setup; npm run copy`
2. `cd site; npm install; hugo -D server`
3. Read and follow `config/README.md` to setup PostgreSQL local connection
4. `cd py` and read `REMIND.sh` because it contans a few notes on requirement packages
5. `sudo apt install inotify-tools`

After, maybe, something would work also in your system: but this is not guarantee, and it is not our goal.
